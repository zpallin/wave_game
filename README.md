Instructions
------------

To install and run this game, you should probably have some basic coding experience. You will be running a webserver locally and serving it to a local network to allow local users to access your page and play.

KEYWORD: local.

If you are looking to deploy this to AWS, you can supply connection string with an ENV variable.

To LAUNCH:

1. Install NodeJS and Git.
2. Pull this repo.
3. Inside the repo, run `npm install`
4. Then, run `npm start`
5. You should be able to access the game locally at `localhost:3000` automatically
6. Or you can figure out your local ip address to access it at `<ip addr>:3000`
7. Profit???
